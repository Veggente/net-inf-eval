# net-inf-eval
Network inference evaluation

Use this module to generate the figures in the paper ["Lower Bounds on Information Requirements for Causal Network Inference" by Kang and Hajek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00055).
1. Install Python packages `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Use `python net_inf_eval.py` to reproduce Figures 2 and 3.  The results may vary due to randomness.
